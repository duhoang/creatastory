const storyText = `Once upon a time, there was a curious little chicken named Chuck. Chuck had always wondered what was on the other side of the road that ran through the farm where he lived. He had heard tales from the other animals about the wonders and adventures that awaited on the other side. So, one day, Chuck decided to find out for himself.

Illustration: In the first illustration, we see Chuck standing on the edge of the road, looking up at the blue sky with a determined expression on his face. He's a small, fluffy white chicken with bright red comb and wattles. In the background, we see the other farm animals, including cows, pigs, and horses, watching curiously as Chuck sets off on his adventure.

Chuck began to walk across the road, taking one careful step at a time. The cars and trucks whizzed past him, honking their horns and causing him to fluff up his feathers in fright. But Chuck didn't give up. He kept walking, his eyes fixed on the other side.

Illustration: In the second illustration, we see Chuck halfway across the road, with his head held high and his wings slightly outstretched for balance. The cars and trucks are blurred streaks of color in the background, emphasizing how small and vulnerable Chuck is compared to the vehicles. His expression is one of determination and bravery.

Finally, Chuck made it to the other side of the road. He looked around in wonder, taking in all the new sights and smells. He saw tall trees with leaves that rustled in the wind, a babbling brook with sparkling water, and colorful flowers that danced in the breeze. Chuck knew that he had made the right decision to cross the road.

Illustration: In the third illustration, we see Chuck standing in a lush green field, surrounded by all the wonders he had seen on the other side of the road. The trees, brook, and flowers are all vividly depicted in bright colors, contrasting with the muted tones of the farmyard in the background. Chuck's eyes are wide with wonder and excitement, and he looks happy and content.

From that day on, Chuck became known as the bravest chicken on the farm. He would often regale the other animals with tales of his adventures on the other side of the road, inspiring them to be more curious and adventurous themselves.

Illustration: In the final illustration, we see Chuck standing tall in the midst of a group of his fellow farm animals, all of whom are listening to him intently. Chuck is animated and enthusiastic, gesturing with his wings and telling his story with great gusto. The other animals are looking at him with admiration and respect, and the farmyard around them is alive with color and activity, emphasizing the newfound spirit of adventure that Chuck has inspired.`
